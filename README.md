## What is Egreens? ##

eGreens, is a hydroponic system to produce fast growing food through the use of technology and automation. With eGreens people will be able to grow their own food, on their own land, regardless of the weather conditions, without the need for agrochemicals, and with the use of the latest cloud technology, recipes of cultivation and artificial intelligence to maximize their production.

## Description <a name="Description"></a>

eGreens is made up of a mobile application, a cloud server, and a local server. The web application allows you to interact with eGreens using any device. The application in IBM Cloud supports all the necessary communication between the web app and the local server. The latter is responsible for being the bridge between the sensors and actuators. All this forms an IoT network, the foundations to enter Industry 4.0, digital twins, and a preparation to enter the world of big data and Artificial Intelligence.

Our subscription model allows  to use it as part of a healthy life or start a business, we will establish alliances with companies and NGOs that join this fight against hunger. We will monetize the app through subscription and advertisements that offer various services related to cultivation.

There are few similar solutions in the market and we will be the solution that helps you make better decisions and intelligently manage your crops.

To make our solution a reality, we have already made the first prototype and will soon be launching it on the market.

At eGreens we believe that ending hunger in Latin America and the world through smart technology is possible, so we invite you to join the project and collaborate to achieve the goal of zero hunger in the world.

# Getting Started with Create React App <a name="Getting-Started"></a>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
